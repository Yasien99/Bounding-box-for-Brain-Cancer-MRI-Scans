**1) Project Title:**
-  Auto-detection and measurement of anatomical coverage on brain MR images

**2) Abstract / Project Summary**:

 -  The aim of this project is to develop a versatile image processing methodology to auto-detect anatomical coverage bounding boxes on brain MR images based on specified anatomic landmarks for example like Right eye, Left eye, Left ear, Right ear in a axial plane in MRI scan. The algorithm will output a binary compliance score that compares the expected bounding box with the actual MR image series like for the previous exapmple if the protocol require that the left ear to right ear and left eye to right eye then the bounding box should coverge this area and then we output the compliance score to assess our approach. This project will be part of a larger pipeline which is Niffler to assess overall quality and compliance on MRI modalities. it will run on DICOM images, specifically brain MRI images in DICOM format.

**6) Personal Background (Brief CV)**

**7) Project Goals / Major Contributions**
- Develop an image processing methodology to auto-detect coverage bounding boxes on brain MR images based on stated anatomic landmarks
- Train and test the algorithm on brain MRI data for validation and accuracy
- Output a binary compliance score based on the comparison between the expected "bounding box" and the actual MR image series

**8) Project Schedule**

**8.1) Community Bonding Period(May 17 - June 6)**

-  Get to know the mentor, review the project details and scope, and clarify any doubts or questions.

-  Set up the development environment, including installing the necessary software tools and libraries.

-  Review the relevant literature on DICOM image processing, auto-detection of anatomical landmarks, and compliance assessment methods.

-  Get familiar with the dataset and pre-processing techniques, including handling DICOM files and applying segmentation algorithms.

**8.2) Development Phase (June 7 - August 9)**

-  Week 1-2 (June 7 - June 20): Develop a basic code structure for the auto-detection of the bounding boxes and measurement of anatomical coverage.

-  Week 3-4 (June 21 - July 4): Improve the code for robustness, accuracy, and scalability, including handling edge cases and error messages.

-  Week 5-6 (July 5 - July 18): Add visualization and reporting features, such as generating heatmaps, histograms, and scatter plots of the compliance scores and anatomical landmarks.

-  Week 7-8 (July 19 - August 1): Integrate the module into the larger pipeline for quality assessment and compliance validation of MRI modalities, including other body parts.

-  Week 9-10 (August 2 - August 9): Test the code on multiple datasets and scenarios, and fine-tune the parameters and algorithms for optimal performance and efficiency.

**8.3) Project Completion, testing, and documentation (August 10 - November 6)**

-  Week 1-2 (August 10 - August 23): Write a detailed technical report on the project, including the background, objectives, methods, results, and conclusions, as well as any limitations, challenges, and future directions.

-  Week 3-4 (August 24 - September 6): Improve the documentation and user manuals for the code, including examples, screenshots, and tutorials, to facilitate its dissemination and reuse.

-  Week 5-6 (September 7 - September 20): Conduct thorough testing and debugging of the code, using both automated and manual methods, to ensure its robustness, reliability, and reproducibility.

-  Week 7-8 (September 21 - October 4): Implement any additional features or functionalities based on user feedback, suggestions, or requirements, and incorporate them into the codebase.

-  Week 9-10 (October 5 - November 6): Prepare the final deliverables, including the source code, documentation, and reports, and present them to the mentor and the community, as well as attend any relevant events, such as the GSoC showcase or the OpenMR Benelux conference.

**9) Planned GSoC work hours**

-  I plan to work full-time on this project, contributing 35 hours a week. I am in the GMT+2 time zone and will be available to work during the day and evenings.


**10) Planned absence/vacation days and other commitments during the GSoC period (including the community bonding period)**

-  I am will graduate this summer so I will need to take a break during my final exams from May 27 to 20 Jun.

-  Also I will defend my bacholr thesis on Jul 27, so I will need to take a break for a week before it from Jul 20 to Jul 27.

**11) Skill Set**

- Strong programming skills in Python

- Familiarity with DICOM images and basic human anatomy

- Experience with machine learning libraries and similar problems

- Previously worked on medical imaging projects, including a web-based AI solution for breast ultrasound

- Completed the Code Challenge and included a link to the code sample in my proposal.
